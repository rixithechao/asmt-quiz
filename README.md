Oh hi! ü¶âüçí

Uh.  I probably should've put a proper readme here???  I'll do that later.
For now, here's the download link for the game because I both didn't use the release system and forgot to tell raocow to put this in the video description too, not just the repo link.  Whoops!

Also this game was made in Godot 4.3, and 4.4 literally just released today so no guarantees it'll work in the latter.  But I don't think there'll be any compatibility issues, and I can see about updating it sometime this week maybe.
